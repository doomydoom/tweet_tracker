Below are theh gems you will need to actively work on the development of
TweetTracker or if you wish to run all the tests of the application. All of
these are optional if you just want to run the system in production.

Factory Girl (gem install thoughtbot-factory_girl --source http://gems.github.com)

Factory Girl is a gem that provides a nice DSL for generating model factories.
I use this throughout testing in order to generate clean, known working models
with all needed attributes.

Ditz (sudo gem install ditz)

Ditz is a distributed issue tracking system written in Ruby. All of the issues
are tracked within the project itself, and can be modified by anyone who has
Ditz installed.

FiveRuns Tuneup (sudo gem install fiveruns_tuneup)

FiveRuns Tuneup is a live profiler. It shows the time spent within controllers
and where the time is being spent. It's great for watching for 'n + 1'
conditions.
